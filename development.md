## ‚úÖ Todo

Day:

- Add how orderby views plugin works a notice in orderby setting.
- Make all components work.
- Add order inside component setting.
- Tabs: flash of content: display only the first tab, even without javascript.

- Verify each icon alignment, in the simple style. Take the reference the user and the calendar icon.

### ‚úÖ Todo Documentation

- Don't forget to add CSS specificity in documentation
- Don't forget to say that tabs are not displayed when only a single tab is displayed.
- Tell how to regenerate icons if one is not displayed.
- When say how to use orderby setting, say to add order by date if ordered first
by something else, like number of comments.
- When writing how the search orderby works in the documentation, add a link to
that from the search orderby note.
- When writing how the meta/meta_num orderby works in the documentation, add a link to
that from the meta/meta_num orderby note.
- Document each orderby option, and see whether or not orderby author/post type/...etc is influenced by order in which we declare authors/post types. 2. Unify parent_id note with post_id note if parent_id are not fetched from the array.
- Add in documentation examples on how to use advanced arguments in query settings and what query filters to use. Also make a link from query settings to documentation?
- Say that you can use Yoast plugin to set the primary category.
- Add in documentation how to set scheduled posts, and link from query settings there.
- Add how orderby views plugin works.

### Plugins

- Make Plugin DFactory Block Suppress filter option.
- GamerZ/BlazK: Sort by most rated/unrated posts.
- Site Reviews Plugin has a custom Category Id ratting, Think if we should implement that.
- Don't know how to count site reviews ratings, maybe email for support?
- Add each plugin, move orderby plugin indicators to classes.
- Test a plugin as a MU plugin to see with debugger how function Post_Meta::get_plugin_version() get the plugin keys, maybe we will need to make another get_plugin_file_relative_path for MU plugins?.

## üéâ Todo: After first release

- ü•á Add taxonomy options(with post formats).
- ‚ûï Add filters for all things.
- ‚ûï Add a way to invert category icons?
- ‚ûï Add a way to "Only Include/Exclude specific posts" to also including all the post children with a checkbox option.
- ‚ûï Add a preview query posts in the backend. If we add a query preview in the backend, add a warning that will say that sticky posts are not included here.
- ‚ûï Add in Date Query settings, a way to select posts from this week and this month, 3-7 days(easy).
- ‚ûï Move all TypeScript display items(Query Settings) into a single one implementation.
- ‚ûï When drag & drop a display item in query setting, add a replace item with the same dimension as the original item that is being dragged.
- ‚ûï Backend typescript is compiled with strict: false option. Try to compile it with strict enable and remove any error.
- ‚ûï Try to change the .pickr class of the color selection. Other plugins might use .pickr and change our CSS.
- ‚ûï Custom date format, make it disabled(not to hide). Does not make any sense to do this.
- ‚ûï When a query is saved or deleted, in the save or delete notification, also add the name of the query(better user experience), if possible.
- ‚ûï Try to speed up plugins, by trying to make a single call to database. For example for a list of posts, don't get the views for each one, but for all together.
- ‚ûï In query templates, when resetting settings, make hidden texts be reset to default 0.
- ‚ûï Add a help button, and with a pop-out to document a setting if needed in General Settings Tab, also the document might be exactly as in documentation.
- Add support for more plugins that support primary category.
